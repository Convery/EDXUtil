**EDXUtil** C++ utility library developed by [Edward Liu](http://behindthepixels.info/). It includes functionalities from low level stl-like data structures and algorithms, vector / matrix math, simple OpenGL encapsulation to simple GUI.

EDXUtil is currently built and tested only on Windows platform. Developer using Visual Studio 2015 should be able to build the source code immediately after syncing.
